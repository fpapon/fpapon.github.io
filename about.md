I'm co-founder and CTO at [Yupiik](https://www.yupiik.com), be involved in some **Apache™** projects (PMC of **Apache Karaf**, **Apache Shiro**, **Apache Unomi**). 

It’s in 2015 that I started to have an interest about OSGi technology and after many PoC, I was thinking:

> *It would be great if a platform can help users to deal with this technology such as a big swiss knife*

And I see **Apache Karaf™**…Wow! Everything I had imagined already existed! I started to be more deeply interested by the project and became to be more involved because I was thinking that if I could help at least, I would be very happy to do it!

I would like to share with you my experience and what I continue to learn every days…

I would like to thanks [Jean-Baptiste Onofré](http://blog.nanthrax.net) (**ASF™** Member, PMC Chair of **Apache Karaf™**, and bunch of other **Apache™** projects!), he is my mentor at **ASF™** and most important, a very closed friend.

Have fun!
